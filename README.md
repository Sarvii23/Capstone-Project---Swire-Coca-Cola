# Capstone-Project---Swire-Coca-Cola

## Summary of business problem and project objective:

Swire Coca-Cola experiences substantial production shortfalls due to frequent unplanned machine downtimes across its six manufacturing plants, achieving only 94.4% of the needed production to meet orders. 
Factors such as specific machine types, plant locations, and equipment categories are associated with higher downtime durations, indicating potential areas for targeted intervention. 
This issue results in approximately $60 million in annual losses. The main challenge is to identify the root causes of these downtimes, predict their occurrence, and implement preventative measures to minimize disruptions.
The objective of this project is to create a predictive maintenance approach that allows Swire Coca-Cola to preemptively manage unplanned equipment failures, reducing unplanned downtimes. 
This will enhance production efficiency, cut emergency repair costs, and ensure the company meets its delivery commitments, directly contributing to improved financial performance. 
Further benefits include optimized maintenance schedules and strategically stocking critical parts to reduce response times.

## Your group's solution to the business problem: 

Our group addressed the business problem by implementing a predictive maintenance solution using time series and survival analysis to forecast equipment failure based on feature-engineered columns: failure risk score and failure risk levels. 
These insights were visualized through two dashboards: a grassroots-level view detailing individual machine performance and a bird's-eye view for strategic oversight across all production locations. 
Additionally, using text analytics, we identified key problem areas, which were Conveyor and Packaging Line Maintenance and Mechanical Repairs and Replacements.

## Your contribution to the project:

I was the subject matter expert for our group. I conducted Survival Analysis to provide a clear timeline of equipment failure based on risk levels, offering actionable insights for preventive maintenance. 
This analysis supported and validated the findings from time series analysis, creating a cohesive narrative. 
Additionally, I worked on business intelligence to ensure the results were effectively translated into an interpretable format, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. 
This combination of analytical rigor and practical application addressed the business problem with precision and clarity.

## The business value of the solution:

By leveraging our predictive models, we demonstrated how Swire could mitigate $27 million of the $60 million potential revenue loss, providing a significant cost-saving and operational efficiency boost.

## Difficulties that your group encountered along the way:

Our group encountered several challenges during the project. 
The data was unclean, with inconsistencies such as machines having start dates after their work order date. 
Additionally, there was no machine expiry date, requiring us to choose a static date arbitrarily. 
The absence of production data limited our ability to interpret production efficiency, and the lack of actual financial and inventory data hindered a more comprehensive analysis. 
Despite these difficulties, we adapted our approach to derive meaningful insights and deliver impactful solutions.

## What you learned in the project:

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in applying advanced analytical techniques, such as time series and survival analysis, to solve real-world business problems. 
I learned the importance of feature engineering in enhancing predictive accuracy, particularly by creating failure risk scores and levels. 
Working with unclean and incomplete data taught me the critical skills of data cleaning, assumption handling, and working with constraints. 
The project also deepened my understanding of business intelligence by translating complex analyses into actionable insights via dashboards. 
Additionally, I honed my teamwork skills, contributed subject matter expertise, and delivered a solution with significant business impactâ€”potentially saving $27 million for Swire.
